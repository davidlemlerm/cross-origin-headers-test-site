# Cross Origin Headers Test Site

This is a site I created to experiment with cross origin requests, HTTP headers such as `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`, and how they work with the CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. The site is built with Jekyll and you can view it built [here](https://cross-origin-headers-test-site.netlify.app) on Netlify.
